# Gateway Hosts Scanner

A simple **host scanner** that runs in a loop, so you don't have to write commands every 2 seconds to check if a host is up.

- **Python 3**

## Running ARS

1. Navigate to the directory where the **ars.py** file is downloaded.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python3 ars.py
## Stopping the Scanner

- To stop the scanner, press **CTRL + C.**
